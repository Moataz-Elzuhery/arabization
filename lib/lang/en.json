    "about": "Arabization is the process of introducing and promoting Arabic language and culture in a society or region where it is not the dominant language. This can involve various measures, such as the adoption of the Arabic language as an official language, the translation of important documents and educational materials into Arabic, and the promotion of Arabic literature and arts.\n\nArabization is often used as a tool for cultural and linguistic imperialism, as it is intended to increase the influence of Arabic culture and language in non-Arab societies or regions. It has been implemented in various forms throughout history, from the spread of the Arabic language through conquests and trade routes in ancient times, to more recent efforts to promote Arabic as a language of education and administration in some countries."
